# Optical Flow Drawing with OpenCV

This project is a fun and interactive computer vision application that allows you to **draw with motion** using your webcam and the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm. Once you click a point on the video, the application tracks its movement and draws a trail following it.


## 📷 Features

- 🎯 Track a point in real-time with your webcam
- ✏️ Draw colorful lines following the motion of your tracked point
- 🔄 Cycle through different colors (`c` key)
- 🧼 Erase drawing canvas (`e` key)
- 🛑 Exit anytime with the `ESC` key


## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
