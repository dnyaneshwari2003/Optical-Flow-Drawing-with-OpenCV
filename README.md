# Optical-Flow-Drawing-with-OpenCV
This project is a fun and interactive computer vision application that allows you to **draw with motion** using your webcam and the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm. Once you click a point on the video, the application tracks its movement and draws a trail following it.
